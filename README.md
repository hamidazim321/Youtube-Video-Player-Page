# Youtube-Video-Player-Page
Microverse Pre-Enrollment Bootcamp Project

I failed the layout in the first one I made. This is the second one.
I changed my approach in this one. I used more columns and containers inside columns to separate the different parts of the page. The page is still not fit to be viewed one small screens yet. And also there are no functions yet. 
Deployed on Github Pages on this link https://hamidazim321.github.io/Youtube-Page-Deployed/
Had to deploy it from another repository because got error 404 when deployed from this repo everytime.
